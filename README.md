# unit-4-rpg-game

A browser-based jQuery game where the player has to select his character and an enemy character and then continuously attack the enemy. The player wins when all the enemies have been defeated. If the player loses all the health points before the enemies are defeated, the player loses the game and will have to start over.

## Project Motivation

This game was developed as part of an introductory jQuery homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is a testament to the mastery of fundamental jQuery concepts that resulted in a game that is simple yet powerful and fun to play. It also goes to show how the jQuery library can be leveraged over vanilla JavaScript to create a reasonably complicated game with only a few lines of code.

## Getting Started

Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine and open index.html using a browser. When the page loads up, the game will start and you start making guesses!
